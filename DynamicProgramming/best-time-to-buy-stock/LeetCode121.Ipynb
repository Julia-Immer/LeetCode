    "# Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**LeetCode 121**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.\n",
    "Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 <= prices.length <= 105\n",
    "    0 <= prices[i] <= 104\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "I first drew a diagram of the possible sales in order to identify the optimal substructure of this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "![All possible buys and sells for a list of 4 prices](sale-options-diagram.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have $n$ prices in our $prices$ list.  The number of possible sales from position zero is $n-1$ since we are trying to sell on a later date.  As we walk through the days, the number of possible stock sales decreases by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here I was able to bust out some pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "    prices = [a, b, c, d] // letters represent values\n",
    "    solution = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    while (i = 0; i < n; i++) :\n",
    "        curr_max = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "        for(k = i + 1; k <= n; k++) :\n",
    "            curr_max = max(prices[k] - prices[i], curr_max) // compare profit of current sale to max so far\n",
    "\n",
    "        solution = max(curr_max, solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution implicityly returns 0 if prices is only one price long.  That is the base case for buying and selling on the same day."
